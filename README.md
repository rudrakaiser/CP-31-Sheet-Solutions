# 📘 CP-31 Sheet – Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the **CP-31 Sheet by TLE Eliminators**.
All problems are solved systematically by increasing **Codeforces rating levels (800 → 1600+)**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To improve my competitive programming skills by solving high-quality curated problems from the CP-31 sheet and track my progress publicly.

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each folder represents a Codeforces difficulty rating:

```
800-rating/
900-rating/
1000-rating/
